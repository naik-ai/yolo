Dominant segment
The dominant segment is the Vacation Ownership (Vacation Ownership, comprised of Wyndham Destinations) segment. This segment includes the Wyndham Destinations business line and generates revenue from the sale of vacation ownership interests and property management services at resorts.

Impact of COVID-19 
The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 include impacts related to the novel coronavirus global pandemic (“COVID-19”).

The net positive impact on Adjusted EBITDA from the COVID-19 related allowance release was $58 million in 2021.
Excluding foreign currency and COVID-19 allowance adjustments, the revenue increase was primarily driven by a $512 million increase in Vacation Ownership segment revenues due to higher VOI sales and property management revenues.
$27 million increased revenues at our Travel and Membership segment driven by higher transaction revenues and subscription revenues as a result of increased marketing and business development efforts, as well as the continued recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. 
Expenses increased by $398 million in 2022 compared to 2021, with an $11 million favorable impact from foreign currency.
